    <h2>Pursuit of career in mathematics</h2>
    <body>In 1910, Ramanujan met deputy collector <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._Ramaswamy_Aiyer">V. Ramaswamy Aiyer</a>, who founded the Indian Mathematical Society.<sup color="blue">[52]</sup> Wishing for a job at the revenue department where Aiyer worked, Ramanujan showed him his mathematics notebooks. As Aiyer later recalled:</body></p>

       <p> <blockquote>I was struck by the extraordinary mathematical results contained in [the notebooks]. I had no mind to smother his genius by an appointment in the lowest rungs of the revenue department.<sup color="blue">[53]</sup></blockquote></p>
        
        <p>Aiyer sent Ramanujan, with letters of introduction, to his mathematician friends in Madras.<sup color="blue">[52]</sup> Some of them looked at his work and gave him letters of introduction to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Ramachandra_Rao">R. Ramachandra Rao</a>, the district collector for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nellore">Nellore</a> and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society.<sup color="blue">[54][55][56]</sup> Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumbai">Bombay</a> mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a fraud.<sup color="blue">[57]</sup> Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's 
            academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_integral">elliptic integrals</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_hypergeometric_series">hypergeometric series</a>, 
        and his theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divergent_series">divergent series</a>, which Rao said ultimately convinced him of Ramanujan's brilliance.<sup color="blue">[57]</sup> When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research with Rao's financial aid. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the <i>Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society</i>.<sup color="blue">[58]</sup></p>

        <p>One of the first problems he posed in the journal<sup color="blue">[30]</sup> was to find the value of : <br>
            <br><br>
        He waited for a solution to be offered in three issues, over six months, but failed to receive any. At the end, Ramanujan supplied an incomplete<sup color="blue">[59]</sup> solution to the problem himself. On page 105 of his first notebook, he formulated an equation that could be used to solve the infinitely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_radical">nested radicals</a> problem.</p>
            <p>Using this equation, the answer to the question posed in the Journal was simply 3, obtained by setting x = 2, n = 1, and a = 0.<sup color="blue">[60]</sup> Ramanujan wrote his first formal paper for the Journal on the properties of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number">Bernoulli numbers</a>. One property he discovered was that the denominators of the fractions of Bernoulli numbers (sequence <a href="https://oeis.org/A027642">A027642</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-Line_Encyclopedia_of_Integer_Sequences">OEIS</a>)

He also devised a method of calculating Bn based on previous Bernoulli numbers. One of these methods follows:</p>
                
        <p>It will be observed that if n is even but not equal to zero,

            <ol>
            <li>
                B<sub><i>n</i></sub> is a fraction and the numerator of B<sub><i>n</i></sub>/<i>n</i> in its lowest terms is a prime number,</li>
           <li> the denominator of Bn contains each of the factors 2 and 3 once and only once,</li>
           <li>2<sup><i>n</i></sup>(2<sup><i>n</i></sup> − 1)⁠B<sub><i>n</i></sub>/<sub><i>n</i></sub>
            is an integer and 2(2<sup><i>n</i></sup> − 1)B<sub><i>n</i></sub> consequently is an odd integer.</li> 
            </ol>  
        </p>

        <p>
            In his 17-page paper "Some Properties of Bernoulli's Numbers" (1911), Ramanujan gave three proofs, two corollaries and three conjectures.<sup>[61]</sup> His writing initially had many flaws. As <i>Journal editor</i> M. T. Narayana Iyengar noted: <br>

 <blockquote>Mr. Ramanujan's methods were so terse and novel and his presentation so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary [mathematical reader], unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could hardly follow him. <sup>[62]</sup></blockquote>

Ramanujan later wrote another paper and also continued to provide problems in the Journal.<sup>[63]</sup> In early 1912, he got a temporary job in the Madras <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountant_General">Accountant General's</a> office, with a monthly salary of 20 rupees. He lasted only a few weeks.<sup>[64]</sup> Toward the end of that assignment, he applied for a position under the Chief Accountant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai_Port">Madras Port</a> Trust.
        </p>

        <p>
            In a letter dated 9 February 1912, Ramanujan wrote:

        <blockquote>Sir,</blockquote>
        <blockquote><blockquote>
        I understand there is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg to apply for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was prevented 
        from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite
         confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.<sup>[65]</sup></blockquote></blockquote><br>

        Attached to his application was a recommendation from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._W._Middlemast">E. W. Middlemast</a>, a mathematics professor at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_College,_Chennai">Presidency College,</a> who wrote that Ramanujan was "a young man of quite exceptional capacity in Mathematics".<sup>[66]</sup> Three weeks after he applied, on 1 March, Ramanujan learned that he had been accepted as a Class III, Grade IV accounting clerk, making 30 rupees per month.<sup>[67]</sup> At his office, 
        Ramanujan easily and quickly completed the work he was given and spent his spare time doing mathematical research. Ramanujan's boss, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Spring">Sir Francis Spring</a>, and S. Narayana Iyer, a colleague who was also treasurer of the Indian Mathematical Society, encouraged Ramanujan in his mathematical pursuits.<sup>[68]</sup>
